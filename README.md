The repo contains various macros writtent for the internal "macroprocessor" language.
The syntax is somewhat similar to C, but many features are missing. For example there are no 'break' and 'continue' keywords and the macro can only have a single level of 'subprograms'. These limitations force to use 'goto' statements.
